I think this is public, I don't know, I don't know github, if so then I guess this isn't a private client like I wanted it to be.

### how to use
don't download this dammit.

> Travis for the whole client
> Rina (Turok) for the framework & bope [https://github.com/SirRina & https://discord.gg/teMyX8] <br>
